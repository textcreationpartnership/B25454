            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>I Was a modeſt maid of <hi>Kent,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who never knew what kiſſing meant;</l>
               <l>Vntil my maſter tempted me,</l>
               <l>With gifts for my virginity.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long was I courted e'er i'd yield,</l>
               <l>And when at laſt he won the field;</l>
               <l>He gave me a lawn kerchief fine</l>
               <l>Declaring that it ſhould be mine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Likewiſe a golden guinea bright,</l>
               <l>That he might lye with me one night;</l>
               <l>I granted his demands ſtraightway</l>
               <l>What laſs alive, could ſay him nay?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He was right generous and free,</l>
               <l>Beſtowing ſuch large gifts on me;</l>
               <l>Yet, I did ſuch a conſcience make,</l>

               <l>My conſcience ſaid, it was too much,</l>
               <l>To take for juſt one ſingle touch;</l>
               <l>And therefore when he laid it down,</l>
               <l>I took no more then one poor crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The which he gave me then with ſpeed,</l>
               <l>And thus we lovingly agréed,</l>
               <l>That he ſhould have my maiden-head:</l>
               <l>I got new cording to my bed,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For fear the old ones they ſhould brake,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Clean ſhéets I likewiſe did provide,</l>
               <l>Nothing was wanting on my ſide:</l>
               <l>Yet when he to my lodging came,</l>
               <l>Alas! he could not play the game.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our game was ſingle rapier firſt;</l>
               <l>Now when he came to give the thruſt,</l>
               <l>A paſs at me could not be made,</l>
               <l>He having ſuch a limber blade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I bid him to his weapon ſtand,</l>
               <l>I crav'd no favour at his hand:</l>
               <l>Yet he was forc'd to ſneak away,</l>
               <l>Before the morning break of day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus was my expectations croſt,</l>
               <l>And my dear maſter's labour loſt:</l>
               <l>Which griev'd my very heart full sore,</l>
               <l>Was ever maid ſo balk'd before?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One ſorrow never comes alone,</l>
               <l>Soon after this my dame did own,</l>
               <l>The handkerchief which then I wore,</l>
               <l>Saying, That it was her's before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then did ſhe fly at me in brief,</l>
               <l>And told me I had play'd the thief.</l>
               <l>Your words I ſcorn, no thief am I,</l>
               <l>Nor ſhall you catch me in a lye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This hankercheif not long ago,</l>
               <l>My maſter did on me beſtow,</l>
               <l>The night before with me he lay;</l>
               <l>Now where's the harm of this I pray?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The miſtreſs flew, and call'd her whore,</l>
               <l>And by the quoif, the maid ſhe tore;</l>
               <l>Muſt you forſooth, my partner be,</l>
               <l>Where there's not half enough for me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Dear miſtreſs be not in a rage,</l>
               <l>You ſpeak the truth I dare ingage:</l>
               <l>For though all night by me he lay,</l>
               <l>He could not one ſweet leſſon play.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ſtrait in wrath reply'd her dame,</l>
               <l>You ſawcy ſlut you are to blame,</l>
               <l>In letting him lye in your bed;</l>
               <l>Suppoſe he'd got your maiden-head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Forſooth, ſaid ſhe, had it been ſo,</l>
               <l>It might have prov'd my overthrow;</l>
               <l>But he can never hurt a maid,</l>
               <l>With ſuch a feeble limber blade.</l>
